## Introduction
In this project, we aim to predict customer churn for subscription-based services. Customer churn, or the rate at which customers discontinue their subscription, is a crucial metric for businesses. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can analyze historical customer data and build a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn. This enables businesses to take proactive measures to retain those customers and optimize their services.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about customers and their subscription-related attributes. It includes features such as gender, age, partner status, contract type, monthly charges, total charges, and churn status (target variable). The dataset is a CSV file named `customer_data.csv` located in the `data` directory.
